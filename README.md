# Owl

## Application to scan video stream or screen captures of multiscreen videowalls and detect and visual annomalies such as blue screens, etc. 

### Development Directions ...
Need:
- Can we get active video feed to work with?  Ask is in place and waiting ...
- How best to determine areas

Remember:
- Write in whatever you want, we can stitch it all together as we go.
- I favor Python 3 with OpenCV and PIL, though there is many, many ways to do this and just because the physical bot piece that I am working on is written in Python, doesn't mean the image analization piece has to be.
